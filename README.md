### Problems MsgLang is Solving
- SMS marketing is a very effective marketing channel but carries high barriers of entry. Adding a simple, low-cost, seamless Monday integration can be a game changing customer magnet.
- Integrating marketing tools with Monday or other CRM tools inevitably leads to added complexity (lost time/money), contact list redundancy, and zappier/integration bugs.
- Marketing tools are expensive. MsgLang will be a low cost, high value replacement.
- Most small/medium-sized business don't have the budget to hire marketing/engineering professionals or the bandwidth to learn and use marketing tools such as autopilot or campaign monitor.

### Features
- Message contacts on Monday Boards directly with no external tools
- Create, Edit, and Delete SMS message templates
- View SMS message templates with a test user
- View Messaging Campaign History

### Benefits
I took great care to create the app in a way that:
- is fully functional within Monday as a Monday App
- uses Monday boards as a data store to reduce dependencies and entire experience in Monday.
- scalable out of the box via serverless functions
- was inspired by Monday UI components
- used React for UI as this is also what seems to be used by Monday
