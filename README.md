### Problems MsgLang is Solving
- Integrating marketing tools with monday or other crm tools inevitably leads to added complexity (lost time/money), contact list redundancy, and zappier/integration bugs.
- Marketing tools are expensive. MsgLang will be a low cost, high value replacement.
- Most small/medium-sized business don't have the budget to hire marketing/engineering professionals or the bandwidth to learn and use marketing tools such as autopilot or campaign monitor.

### Features
- Message contacts on Monday Boards directly with no external tools

- uses Monday boards as a data store to reduce dependencies
- scalable out of the box via serverless functions
